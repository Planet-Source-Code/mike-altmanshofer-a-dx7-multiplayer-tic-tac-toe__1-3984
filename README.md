## A DX7 MultiPlayer Tic Tac Toe


</div>

### Description

This is an example of using DX7 DirectPlay4. Program allows you to connect and play a basic tic tac toe game over ipx, tcp/ip, or modem against another player with the same program installed. This program includes a basic chat program. All of the multiplayer code is done with directplay4. This is a multiplayer tic tac toe game i originally wrote using the com port across a modem. I recently ported it to directplay4 just for the fun of it thought the code might be helpful. Requires DIRECTX7 SDK to compile and DIRECTX7 runtime to play.
